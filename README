GPS Route Recording and Replay app for Android.
===============================================

As GPS satellites have a 12-hour orbit, following the exact same path 12 or 24 hours later will have the same satellites visible, and should result in the same GPS behaviour.

RouteReplay shows your current and expected position, so that you can follow the same path at the same speed and repeat GPS experiments in the same environment.
